# ClimateWatch-Data-Analysis
  - This is a brief analysis of data offered by [ClimateWatch](https://www.climatewatchdata.org/data-explorer) under various subdivisions such as **Climate** and its effects factors such as **Green House Gases, Agriculture, SocioEconomic Indicators**, etc.
  - The notebook in this repository in my result of exploration of various Machine Learning stuffs present in **Tensorflow** (basically just messing around with things that are already present :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: ), therfore, some results are inconclusive.
  - Usage of **ipywidgets** has been implemented for the ease of data selection.
  - Use [Voila](https://pypi.org/project/voila/) along with Jupyter Notebooks for better experience
